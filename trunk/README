buildpkg: a simple package building system for Slackware (-like) distributions
==============================================================================

Buildpkg is a simple software/package building system for Slackware
compatible distributions.

It is very similar to the ArchLinux 'makepkg' command, and works in similar
ways. But it is developed and adapted for Slackware systems.

Introduction:
-------------

The buildpkg command is a simple bash script. You start it in the builddir
of the software you wish to build. A buildir is a directory, usually within
your home directory, which contains the required files to create packages
with buildpkg.

These files are BUILD and slack-desc. buildpkg also supports the inclusion
of doinst.sh, slack-required, slack-suggests and slack-conflicts files.


The BUILD file is a simple bash file that will be "sourced" by the buildpkg
command:

pkgname=buildpkg
pkgver=0.1a
src="http://www.downloadsite.com/$pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz"
build=1jtn

build() {
	cd $pkgname-$pkgver
	mkdir -p $PKG/usr/bin
	install -m755 buildpkg $PKG/usr/bin
	install -m755 genpkg $PKG/usr/bin
}




The slack-desc file is the standard slackware format:
