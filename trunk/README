buildpkg: a simple package building system for Slackware (-like) distributions
==============================================================================

Buildpkg is a simple software/package building system for Slackware
compatible distributions.

It is very similar to the ArchLinux 'makepkg' command, and works in similar
ways. But it is developed and adapted for Slackware systems.

Introduction:
-------------

The buildpkg command is a simple bash script. You start it in the builddir
of the software you wish to build. A buildir is a directory, usually within
your home directory, which contains the required files to create packages
with buildpkg.

These files are BUILD and slack-desc. buildpkg also supports the inclusion
of doinst.sh, slack-required, slack-suggests and slack-conflicts files.


The BUILD file is a simple bash file that will be "sourced" by the buildpkg
command:

pkgname=buildpkg
pkgver=0.1a
src="http://frogde.sf.net/$pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz"
build=1dxt

build() {
	cd $pkgname-$pkgver
	mkdir -p $PKG/usr/bin
	install -m755 buildpkg $PKG/usr/bin
	install -m755 genpkg $PKG/usr/bin
}




The slack-desc file is the standard slackware format:

A great tool and source of information for creating slack-* files can be
found at http://www.linuxpackages.net/howto.php?page=perfect-package.


Also included is genpkg. genpkg is a shell script found on the slapt-get
home page, and is used to regenerate your local package repository when
using slapt-get.

Packages built by buildpkg will be moved to /usr/src/packages. In order to
use this directory as a slapt-get repository, you have to add the line

SOURCE=file///usr/src/packages

to your /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc file.

buildpkg will update the repository everytime a package is created. All you
need to do then is:
- run slapt-get --update
- slapt-get --install <package>, where <package> is the name of the package
  that you just built.
