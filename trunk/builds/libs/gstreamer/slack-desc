gstreamer: GStreamer is a library that allows the construction of graphs of
gstreamer: media-handling components, ranging from simple Ogg/Vorbis
gstreamer: playback to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing)
gstreamer: processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec
gstreamer: and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs
gstreamer: and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic
gstreamer: interface. GStreamer is released under the LGPL.
